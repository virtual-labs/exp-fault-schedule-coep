#### Here is a procedure for fault finding and maintenance of a process plant with a high level of automation as per international standard:

Procedure for Fault Finding and Maintenance

#### Step 1: Identify the Fault

Identify the fault or abnormal condition in the process plant, using:

-	Alarm systems and notifications
-	Process monitoring and control systems
-	Operator feedback and observations
-	Automated fault detection systems (e.g., predictive maintenance)

#### Step 2: Isolate the Fault

Isolate the fault or affected area to prevent further damage or propagation of the fault, using:

-	Shutdown or isolation valves
-	Electrical isolation switches
-	Mechanical isolation devices (e.g., couplings, valves)

#### Step 3: Analyze the Fault

Analyze the fault or abnormal condition to determine the root cause, using:

-	Data analysis and trending
-	Process modeling and simulation
-	Fault tree analysis
-	Root cause analysis (RCA) techniques

#### Step 4: Develop a Repair Plan

Develop a repair plan to correct the fault or abnormal condition, including:

-	Identification of required spare parts and materials
-	Estimation of repair time and resources
-	Development of a detailed repair procedure
-	Coordination with maintenance and operations teams

#### Step 5: Execute the Repair

Execute the repair plan, using:

-	Trained and qualified maintenance personnel
-	Specialized tools and equipment
-	Adherence to safety procedures and protocols
-	Quality control and verification procedures

#### Step 6: Test and Validate

Test and validate the repair to ensure the fault or abnormal condition is corrected, using:

-	Functional testing and verification
-	Performance testing and validation
-	Process monitoring and control systems
-	Operator feedback and observations

#### Step 7: Document and Review

Document the fault finding and maintenance activities, including:

-	Fault description and analysis
-	Repair plan and execution
-	Test and validation results
-	Lessons learned and recommendations for improvement
-	Review the fault finding and maintenance activities to identify opportunities for improvement, using:
-	Root cause analysis (RCA) techniques
-	Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
-	Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) techniques
International Standards for Fault Finding and Maintenance
The fault finding and maintenance procedure should be developed in accordance with international standards, such as:
-	ISA (International Society of Automation) standard 95, "Enterprise-Control System Integration"
-	IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standard 61511, "Functional Safety - Safety Instrumented Systems for the Process Industry Sector"
-	API (American Petroleum Institute) standard 754, "Process Safety Performance Indicators for the Refining and Petrochemical Industries"
Example of a Fault Finding and Maintenance Procedure
Here is an example of a fault finding and maintenance procedure for a process plant with a high level of automation:
This is a simplified example, and the actual fault finding and maintenance procedure will vary depending on the specific process plant and its requirements.

By following this procedure, you can ensure that faults are quickly identified and corrected, minimizing downtime and ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the process plant.
